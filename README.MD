# Machine Learning Final Project
## Trading Algorithm Python 3.5 

![Alt text](src/lines.png)
Github repository for the machine learning trading algorithm. Still a work in progress. The goal is to use candle sticks in order to determine when to buy or hold a stock. 

### Setup
1. Have pip installed on your [system](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) 
2. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the command jupyter lab inside src directory
4. Go into the ipython notebook candle stick plot and play around

### To Do
1. Implement optimization algorithm to decide on Q function weights
2. Use these q function weights in order to develop a trading policy
3. Further investigation on ways to improve either of these two
